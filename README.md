# PWC code test - weather widget

Thanks for providing the code test.

## Demo
http://www.runademo.com/pwc-code-test-weather/

## Notes
* Some content e.g Pollen is not there as the API doesn't have the relevant data field
* As the code is a bit short, everything is put in one file which is not ideal. Normally, components, web services, utility functions, etc are seperately into files/modules
* `flex-wrap` is used to control responsiveness for simplicity. In real cases, media queries and break points will be used as per requirements.

## Install
```
npm i
```

## Run
```
npm run dev
```
